0.06 2015-08-01

 - Jump straight to version 0.06 so that this module can be indexed by PAUSE.
 - Actually allow fractional seconds for the timeout argument.
 - Don't pass the timeout value in sub_store_args, that makes no sense.
 - Use Sys::SigAction to do the timeouts rather than hand rolling it.
 - Move the TimeoutStore plugin to a separate distribution.
